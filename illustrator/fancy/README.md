# Fancy Fonts

## Story

You want to create a cool header to a website for your writer friend but you don't know what would be the perfect font for this.
Luckily you find a good looking font in Google Fonts, so you need to import it in Illustrator.

## What are you going to learn?

- Using third-party fonts in Illustrator
- Using fonts in inline SVGs
- Using third-party fonts in HTML

## Tasks

1. Import the `Montserrat` font from Google Fonts into Illustrator and write down the phrase in two lines `Life is all about writing` with two different font size and font weight. Create a colored rectangle as a background. Export it with Export for Screen, and place it to an HTML file.
    - The phrase `Life is all about writing` is presented in the middle of an HTML page with the font-family `Montserrat`

2. When your friend saw the result, he didn't like that there isn't enough space between the words. Widen the space between the letters.
    - Widen the space between the letters
    - The final result looks like this ![Life is all about writing](https://learn.code.cool/media/frontend/life-is-all-about-writing.png)

## General requirements

## Hints

- You can modify the kerning settings (line-spacing, character-spacing) in Illustrator by clicking between two letters.
- When you export the SVG file, keep the texts as texts.
- You need to import the font-family into the HTML if you want the font-family to prevail in the logo.
