        <p id="firstletter">Tyrol’s version of Siberia is a place where farmers and bears eat from the same bowl and
          children ride on the backs of wolves, wrote Innsbrucker Handelsblatt of the 9-home Alpine village of Sulden
          back in 1802.

          Located at the foot of the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s highest peak - the 3,900 metre Ortler - Sulden sits 1,906
          meters above sea level and was probably one of the most isolated villages of the Alps until 1825 when the
          Stelvio Pass was built. This paved pass is of the world’s most beautiful mountain roads, doubling as a stretch
          of the Giro d’Italia cycling race each summer.

        Of course the wild natural environment encircling Sulden has barely changed, and it’s remained a destination for
        those wanting to lose and seclude themselves. This is where Winston Churchill came to rest between the two world
        wars, where composer Richard Strauss visited, and where German chancellor Angela Merkel has returned more than
        once. But, tellingly, Sulden is the birthplace of Reinhold Messner - one of the giants of modern mountaineering,
        and this is where he formed his school for alpinists, opened a museum, and even operates a yak farm!

        So, starting from Sulden, we too went on a wilderness discovery adventure, heading toward the peak of Ortler, in
        the hope of stumbling upon those children riding wolves. We avoid the tracks and pistes, and stick to the
        untouched snow of the yet-to-be-discovered natural landscape.
